          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Jacob Martinez and I have loved working with computers ever since I took apart my first computer a couple months before my 11th birthday. From there I began expressing huge interest in Video Games which ultimately led to my interest in the field of Computer Science and web development.</p>

          <h2>My Skills</h2>
          <p>Although I have years of experience working in multiple programming languages, I decided to really specialize in web design and user experience when I came to college. I worked as a freelance developer working closely on a project with a 5+ year designer where I learned many different tips and tricks to initially get me started. This ultimately landed me a job working for the College of Education at Michigan State as a Web Developer. I have been working here, along with doing freelance web development since August of 2014.</p>

              <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
              <p>The backbone to any website, without HTML, there would be no structure to the content, and without CSS, it would have no style or wow factor to websites for readability and cosmetically appealing. Every professional in a skill set has mastered the fundamentals in order to get where they are, and that is exactly what I have done with HTML and CSS.</p>

              <h2>JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY</h2>
              <p>A great looking website sure does look good, but what good does a website do no matter how good it looks, if it doesn't work? I have studied and worked with many different ways you can use javascript and jquery libraries to be able to make a website do extraordinary things.</p>

              <h2>PHP/MYSQL</h2>
              <p>We are moving into the age of information, and with that, things are constantly changing and being updated. Database management is the #1 way to be able to update information and be able to keep an archive of old information. A great example of using databases are for blogs, e-commerce, and even for user management/user content systems.</p>

            <div class="skill">
              <h2>WORDPRESS SYSTEMS</h2>
              <p>From a design standpoint, Wordpress is by far the best system when creating a website for a small user that just want's to create a blog. It gives the client the ability to pick and choose different aspects of multiple themes to really make it feel like it is customized to their liking. Also with how easy it is to edit they most likely won't run into any huge issues, which makes the designers life a lot easier.</p>
